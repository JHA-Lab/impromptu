# Im-Promptu: Visual Analogy Suite

This folder contains the visual analogy tasks used for the paper Im-Promptu: In-Context Composition from Image Prompts. Each benchmark has been separately described below. Each visual analogy suite is divided into two broad kind of analogies depending on the underlying relation - * Primitive * and * Composite * tasks

(1) Primitive: A single image attribute is modified at a time. For example, the color of the object is changed from red to blue.

(2) Composite: Multiple image attributes are modified at a time. For example, the color of the object is changed from red to blue and the scene orientation is changed from -15 degrees to +15 degrees.
